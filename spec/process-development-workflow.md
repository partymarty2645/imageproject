# Introduction

This specification defines the development process, testing strategy, and deployment workflow for "A Thoughtful Moment", a couples journaling application. It establishes standardized procedures for code development, quality assurance, and production deployment.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This specification defines the complete software development lifecycle process for the A Thoughtful Moment application, including development workflows, testing procedures, deployment pipelines, and quality assurance standards.

**Intended Audience**: Developers, QA engineers, DevOps engineers, and project managers working on the application.

**Assumptions**: Development team follows modern web development practices and has access to required development tools and environments.

## 2. Definitions

- **Development Environment**: Local development setup with Vite dev server, Firebase emulators, and hot reloading
- **Build Process**: Automated compilation and optimization using Vite for production deployment
- **Testing Pyramid**: Hierarchical testing approach with unit tests at base, integration tests in middle, and E2E tests at top
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated workflow for code integration, testing, and deployment
- **Code Coverage**: Percentage of codebase exercised by automated tests
- **Performance Budget**: Defined limits for application loading times, bundle sizes, and runtime performance

## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

### Development Process Requirements

- **QUA-004**: Performance monitoring must be implemented in production
- **QUA-005**: Error tracking and logging must be configured for production

## 4. Interfaces & Data Contracts

### Development Workflow Interfaces

```typescript
interface PullRequest {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  branch: string;
  reviewers: string[];
  labels: string[];
  checks: CheckStatus[];
}

interface CheckStatus {
  name: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'success' | 'failure';
  conclusion?: string;
}

interface TestResult {
  suite: string;
  tests: number;
  passes: number;
  failures: number;
  coverage: CoverageReport;
}

interface CoverageReport {
  statements: number;
  branches: number;
  functions: number;
  lines: number;
}
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Interfaces

```bash
# Build Command Interface
npm run build

# Test Command Interface
npm run test
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# Deploy Command Interface
firebase deploy --only hosting
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Environment Configuration Interface

```bash
# Development Environment
NODE_ENV=development
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=dev-key
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=dev-project

# Production Environment
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=prod-key
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=prod-project
GEMINI_API_KEY=prod-gemini-key
GITHUB_TOKEN=prod-github-token
```

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-001**: Given a developer creates a pull request, when all CI checks pass, then the code can be merged to main branch
- **AC-002**: Given a new feature is implemented, when unit tests are written, then code coverage remains above 80%
- **AC-003**: Given application code is ready for release, when build process completes, then optimized production bundle is generated
- **AC-004**: Given production deployment succeeds, when application loads, then all features work correctly in production environment
- **AC-005**: Given a bug is reported, when fix is implemented, then regression tests prevent similar issues

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

### Test Levels
- **Unit Tests**: Component logic, custom hooks, utility functions, service methods
- **Integration Tests**: Firebase operations, AI service integration, image processing pipeline
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows from authentication to content creation

### Test Frameworks
- **Unit Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for component and hook testing
- **Integration Testing**: Firebase emulators + Jest for backend service testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for browser automation and user journey testing

### Test Execution Strategy
- **Pre-commit**: TypeScript compilation and linting
- **Pull Request**: Full test suite execution with coverage reporting
- **Merge**: Integration and E2E tests on main branch
- **Release**: Full regression test suite and performance validation

### Test Data Management
- **Unit Tests**: Mock data and stubbed dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Firebase emulator with predefined test data
- **E2E Tests**: Isolated test environment with clean state

### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing on every push and pull request
- **Firebase Emulators**: Local testing environment for Firestore and Auth
- **Codecov**: Coverage reporting and quality gates
- **Lighthouse CI**: Performance budget validation

## 7. Rationale & Context

### Development Process Design
- **Git Flow**: Feature branches with pull request reviews ensure code quality
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage prevents regressions and validates functionality
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience
- **Modular Architecture**: Component-based structure enables parallel development and testing

### Testing Strategy Rationale
- **Testing Pyramid**: Efficient resource allocation with fast unit tests and targeted integration/E2E tests
- **Firebase Emulators**: Local testing environment eliminates external dependencies during development

    const { result } = renderHook(() => useDailyView(mockProps));
    expect(result.current.state.loading).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should handle question creation', async () => {
    const mockCreateDailyData = jest.fn();
    // Test question creation logic
  });
});
```
